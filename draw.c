looked up once, at the program initialization, which makes successive calls to this pixel caller quicker.

/**
This function draws a "bitmap" in a very particular fashion: it takes as input the matrix of chars to draw.
In this matrix, each char represents the index to look it up in the palette variable which is also passed.
Alpha isn't used here, and instead allows the "magic color" of 0x272727 to be "skipped" when drawing.
By looking up the color in the palette, the bitmap can be smaller. Before compression was implemented, this was
more important. A potential speedup may be to integrate the three pixel colors into a matrix prior to this function.
